# Gun Control Project

#### The U.S. is one of the few countries that allow citizens to have or carry a gun. This law has made many problems throughout U.S. history, and some people think guns should be banned. However, the other side believes that the same problems happen in other countries, and banning guns doesn't solve anything. In this project, I used python and its packages related to data science to see the effect of gun control on the number of crimes.
